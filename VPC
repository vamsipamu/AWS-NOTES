# VPC

Imagine you want to set up a private, secure, and isolated area in the cloud where you can run your applications and store your data. This is where a VPC comes into play.

A VPC is a virtual network that you create in the cloud. It allows you to have your own private section of the internet, just like having your own network within a larger network. Within this VPC, you can create and manage various resources, such as servers, databases, and storage.

Think of it as having your own little "internet" within the bigger internet. This virtual network is completely isolated from other users' networks, so your data and applications are secure and protected.

Just like a physical network, a VPC has its own set of rules and configurations. You can define the IP address range for your VPC and create smaller subnetworks within it called subnets. These subnets help you organize your resources and control how they communicate with each other.

To connect your VPC to the internet or other networks, you can set up gateways or routers. These act as entry and exit points for traffic going in and out of your VPC. You can control the flow of traffic and set up security measures to protect your resources from unauthorized access.

With a VPC, you have control over your network environment. You can define access rules, set up firewalls, and configure security groups to regulate who can access your resources and how they can communicate.


By default, when you create an AWS account, AWS will create a default VPC for you but this default VPC is just to get started with AWS. You should create VPCs for applications or projects. 

## VPC components 

The following features help you configure a VPC to provide the connectivity that your applications need:

Virtual private clouds (VPC): A VPC is a virtual network that closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center. After you create a VPC, you can add subnets.

Subnets: A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. A subnet must reside in a single Availability Zone. After you add subnets, you can deploy AWS resources in your VPC.

IP addressing: You can assign IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6, to your VPCs and subnets. You can also bring your public IPv4 and IPv6 GUA addresses to AWS and allocate them to resources in your VPC, such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and Network Load Balancers.

Network Access Control List (NACL): A Network Access Control List is a stateless firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level. It operates at the IP address level and can allow or deny traffic based on rules that you define. NACLs provide an additional layer of network security for your VPC.
   
Security Group: A security group acts as a virtual firewall for instances (EC2 instances or other resources) within a VPC. It controls inbound and outbound traffic at the instance level. Security groups allow you to define rules that permit or restrict traffic based on protocols, ports, and IP addresses.  

Routing: Use route tables to determine where network traffic from your subnet or gateway is directed.

Gateways and endpoints: A gateway connects your VPC to another network. For example, use an internet gateway to connect your VPC to the internet. Use a VPC endpoint to connect to AWS services privately, without the use of an internet gateway or NAT device.

Peering connections: Use a VPC peering connection to route traffic between the resources in two VPCs.

Traffic Mirroring: Copy network traffic from network interfaces and send it to security and monitoring appliances for deep packet inspection.

Transit gateways: Use a transit gateway, which acts as a central hub, to route traffic between your VPCs, VPN connections, and AWS Direct Connect connections.

VPC Flow Logs: A flow log captures information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.

VPN connections: Connect your VPCs to your on-premises networks using AWS Virtual Private Network (AWS VPN).
 


AWS (Amazon Web Services) provides multiple layers of security to protect resources and data within its cloud infrastructure. Two important components for network security in AWS are Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists (NACLs). Let's explore how each of them works:


Security Groups:
    Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for Amazon EC2 instances (virtual servers) at the instance level. They control inbound and outbound traffic by allowing or denying specific protocols, ports, and IP addresses.
    Each EC2 instance can be associated with one or more security groups, and each security group consists of inbound and outbound rules.
    Inbound rules determine the traffic that is allowed to reach the EC2 instance, whereas outbound rules control the traffic leaving the instance.
    Security Groups can be configured using IP addresses, CIDR blocks, security group IDs, or DNS names to specify the source or destination of the traffic.
    They operate at the instance level and evaluate the rules before allowing traffic to reach the instance.
    Security Groups are stateful, meaning that if an inbound rule allows traffic, the corresponding outbound traffic is automatically allowed, and vice versa.
    Changes made to security group rules take effect immediately.

Network Access Control Lists (NACLs):
    NACLs are an additional layer of security that operates at the subnet level. They act as stateless traffic filters for inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet boundary.
    Unlike Security Groups, NACLs are associated with subnets, and each subnet can have only one NACL. However, multiple subnets can share the same NACL.
    NACLs consist of a numbered list of rules (numbered in ascending order) that are evaluated in order from lowest to highest.
    Each rule in the NACL includes a rule number, protocol, rule action (allow or deny), source or destination IP address range, port range, and ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) type.
    NACL rules can be configured to allow or deny specific types of traffic based on the defined criteria.
    They are stateless, which means that if an inbound rule allows traffic, the corresponding outbound traffic must be explicitly allowed using a separate outbound rule.
    Changes made to NACL rules may take some time to propagate to all the resources using the associated subnet.

VPC END POINT:

A VPC Endpoint: it’s a way to privately connect your VPC to AWS services without using the public internet. There are two types of VPC Endpoints:

Types:	
Interface Endpoint: Uses an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in your subnet to connect to services via AWS PrivateLink	
Most AWS services (e.g., EC2, SQS, SNS, API Gateway)	
Charges apply

Gateway Endpoint: Adds a route in your VPC route table to connect directly to services like S3 or DynamoDB	
Only Amazon S3 and DynamoDB	
Free

So, Interface Endpoints are a type of VPC Endpoint—specifically the one you use when you need to connect to services that support PrivateLink.
hey’re ideal when:

You want private access to services like EC2, CloudWatch, or Secrets Manager.

You need cross-region or on-premises connectivity via Direct Connect or VPN.

You’re working with third-party services in AWS Marketplace.

Meanwhile, Gateway Endpoints are simpler and cost-free, but limited to just S3 and DynamoDB.
