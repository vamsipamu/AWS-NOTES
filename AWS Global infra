ðŸ§± Core AWS Infrastructure Components
Regions
Geographically isolated areas where AWS services are hosted.
Each Region contains multiple Availability Zones.
Example: us-east-1 (N. Virginia), ap-south-1 (Mumbai).

Availability Zones (AZs)
Physically separate data centers within a Region.
Designed for fault tolerance and high availability.
You can deploy applications across AZs to ensure resilience.

Edge Locations
Part of Amazon CloudFront (CDN).
Used to cache content closer to users for faster delivery.
Ideal for low-latency access to static and dynamic content.

Local Zones
Extend AWS services to locations closer to end-users.
Useful for latency-sensitive applications like gaming or video streaming.

Wavelength Zones
Embedded in telecom networks to support ultra-low latency 5G applications.
Ideal for real-time machine learning, AR/VR, and IoT.

AWS Outposts
Brings AWS infrastructure and services to on-premises environments.
Enables hybrid cloud setups with consistent APIs and tools.

Regional Edge Caches
Larger caches than Edge Locations.
Improve performance by reducing the need to go back to the origin server.
